# Omics Data Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis projects and reports for the "Omics Data Analysis" course as part of the Master's program at the University of Murcia. The focus of this study is on the systemic inflammatory response to sepsis in mouse models, analyzed using three omics technologies: Metagenomics, RNAseq, and scRNAseq.

## Project Overview

Sepsis is a critical global health issue characterized by a severe inflammatory response to infection, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. This project aims to dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration associated with sepsis using a murine model. Specifically, it investigates differences in response between male and female mice and attempts a holistic integration of metagenomic, transcriptomic, and single-cell data to uncover potential therapeutic targets.

### Objectives

1. **RNAseq Analysis**: Explore molecular and cellular mechanisms implicated in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in sepsis.
2. **scRNAseq Analysis**: Detail the cellular response to sepsis by isolating specific cell types such as microglial macrophages and lymphoid cells.
3. **Metagenomic Analysis**: Examine whether baseline microbiota influences the central nervous system's response to systemic inflammation.

## Data Description

The data used in this study were generously provided by the Experimental Ophthalmology group at the University of Murcia. This includes raw FASTQ files for RNAseq and scRNAseq, and processed metagenomic data.

### Analysis Details

- **RNAseq**: Conducted at multiple time points post-infection to identify critical pathways and nodal genes across different stages of sepsis.
- **Metagenomics**: Focused on the microbiota's role in modulating immune responses, potentially influencing neuroinflammatory susceptibility.
- **scRNAseq**: Targeted analysis of immune cells, distinguishing between activation states and cellular types during the inflammatory response.
